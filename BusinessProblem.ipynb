        "This project aims at segmenting the shopping venues into clusters based on their distance from the neighborhood centre they are present and explore various aspects like most common distances for shops to be found, etc. Intuitively, based on geography of the city, the shops that are located within a close range to any neighborhood gets grouped into one cluster. This helps in identifying shops that are outliers and customers may need to go out of their way or through a secluded area to have access to them. This can result in possible threats like robbing, lack of timely emergency services, or in the worst case scenarios life threatening events.    "
